A Python library for pre-processing ubiquitous aggregated self-tracking data.

## What is this library about

This library is influenced by the work of ours in which we utilized in-the-wild data
coming from the "MyHeart Counts" study [1].

Through our time-consuming experimentation with these real-world data, we extracted 
a set of prescriptive guidelines of pre-processing steps related to aggregated data 
gathered from wearable devices.

We hope "UBIWEAR" serves as a starting point to the research community towards the unexplored 
domain of physical activity prediction and promote a standardized definition for pre-processing
wearables and self-tracking devices data.

## When to use this library

To the best of our knowledge since this library was written, there were no
suggested techniques to apply for handling time-series data coming from self-tracking devices.

Through "UBIWEAR" we offer some pre-processing methods related to time-series problems
with some slight modifications exclusively for wearables data.
